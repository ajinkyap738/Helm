ðŸ”§ What is Helm?
Helm helps you define, install, and upgrade complex Kubernetes applications. It uses Helm charts, which are collections of YAML templates that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.

âœ… Why Use Helm?
Managing applications in Kubernetes using raw YAML files can quickly become repetitive, error-prone, and hard to maintainâ€”especially for large deployments. Helm solves this by:

Templating YAML â€“ Reduces duplication via variables and logic.

Version Control â€“ Helm charts can be versioned and reused.

Dependency Management â€“ Helm manages charts that rely on other charts.

Easier Upgrades and Rollbacks â€“ You can upgrade and roll back applications easily.

Community Ecosystem â€“ Huge repository of prebuilt charts (e.g., for PostgreSQL, Prometheus).

ðŸš€ How to Use Helm (Basic Flow)

Install Helm:

brew install helm     # macOS
sudo snap install helm --classic   # Linux


--------------------------------------------

Add a Chart Repository:

helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update



----------------------------------------------

Install a Chart:

helm install my-release bitnami/nginx

----------------------------------------------

List Installed Releases:

helm list

----------------------------------------------
Upgrade a Release:

helm upgrade my-release bitnami/nginx


----------------------------------------------
Uninstall a Release:

helm uninstall my-release


----------------------------------------------

Create Your Own Chart:
helm create mychart

----------------------------------------------
