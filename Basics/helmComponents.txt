1. Helm Components (Tooling)
These are the tools that make up the Helm ecosystem:

Helm CLI: The command-line interface for interacting with Helm (e.g., helm install, helm upgrade).

Helm Charts: Packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

Chart Repository: A place where charts are stored and shared (e.g., ArtifactHub).

--------------------------------------

2. Helm Chart Structure (Chart Components)
Each Helm chart has a specific directory structure and files:

mychart/
  Chart.yaml          # Chart metadata (name, version, description)
  values.yaml         # Default configuration values
  charts/             # Subcharts (dependencies)
  templates/          # Kubernetes manifests with Go templating
  templates/_helpers.tpl # Template helpers (e.g., functions)
  README.md           # Documentation (optional)

Key Files:
Chart.yaml: Metadata like chart name, version, and dependencies.

values.yaml: User-configurable values to customize the deployment.

templates/: Contains the actual Kubernetes YAML files (e.g., Deployments, Services), but they use Go templating to be dynamic.

_helpers.tpl: Contains template functions and helpers for reusability.

---------------------------------------------------------

3. Additional Concepts
Releases: A specific deployment of a chart to a Kubernetes cluster.

Hooks: Scripts or actions that run at specific points in a release lifecycle (e.g., before install, after upgrade).

Subcharts: Charts that are dependencies of another chart, defined in the charts/ directory or via dependencies in Chart.yaml.
