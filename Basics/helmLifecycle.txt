Helm Lifecycle Management refers to the process of managing the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications using Helm, the popular package manager for Kubernetes. This lifecycle includes:

üîÅ Helm Application Lifecycle Stages:
Package Creation (helm create, helm package)

Helm charts are developed to define Kubernetes resources.

Charts include templates, values files, and dependencies.

Installation (helm install)

Deploy a Helm chart into a Kubernetes cluster.

Helm renders templates into Kubernetes manifests and applies them.

Upgrade (helm upgrade)

Modify a deployed release (e.g., change configurations or chart versions).

Helm performs a diff and applies only the changes.

Rollback (helm rollback)

Revert to a previous release version if the current one has issues.

Uninstallation (helm uninstall)

Remove the resources deployed by a Helm release.

Release Management

Helm tracks releases in a history with version numbers.

Use helm list, helm history, etc., to manage releases.

Chart Versioning and Dependency Management

Helm supports versioned charts and dependencies via Chart.yaml.

Use helm dependency update for pulling chart dependencies.

üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices for Lifecycle Management:
Use GitOps: Store chart values and release configurations in Git for traceability.

Automated CI/CD: Integrate Helm with pipelines for repeatable deployments.

Values Validation: Use schema validation (values.schema.json) to catch errors early.

Use helm diff Plugin: To preview changes before applying them.

Test Charts: Use helm test for post-deployment validation.
