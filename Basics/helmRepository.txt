A Helm repository is a place where Helm charts (which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources) are stored and shared. Helm uses these repositories to install applications and manage deployments on Kubernetes clusters.

Key Concepts:
Helm Chart: A bundle of YAML files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.

Repository: A collection of Helm charts, typically stored on a web server and accessible via a URL.
